# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

	My project PicCarto will be an android app which will enable the user to generate custom maps from a photo or image file. PicCarto will scale the map based on the gps location of the user when they are at known locations on the custom map, and will overlay this scaled image onto google’s standard map. Scaling in current competitor apps are based only on two points which doesn’t account for skewed images, or maps that are not truly to scale. My initial algorithm will scale on a up to 3 non-linear points which will allow for the elimination of skew, future iterations will allow for more points which will allow for maps not drawn to scale to be utilized. 
	The custom map core feature was inspired by a trip to the KC Zoo. Reading a paper map is a dead skill for most potential users, and google maps does not cover the layout of attractions such as parks, zoos or themeparks. Additional use cases include realtors, utilities, EMS services, or anyone who wishes to use a more specialized map within GPS navigation. 
	 Additional functionalities may be added in future iterations to make PicCarto a better companion application for sharing experiences within the attraction use case scenario.


### Features

1. User authentication using Googles Authentication API or username password.

2. Image upload functionality.

3. Map location point selector for scaling of custom map image.

4. Navigation view using scaled custom map image. 


### Technologies

1. Google Authentication API

2. Google Maps API


### What I'll Have to Learn

1. Android development with Android Studio. It is mostly based on java, and seems to be set up much like IntelliJ both are by JetBrains. I do have some very limited experience tinkering in Android Studio, so I am already a bit familiar with it. 

2. Image manipulation within Java. This was a topic covered in the Python unit of the class to some extent, so I have some ideas, but the functionality I have in mind is much more advanced than the exercised undertaken in the course of that unit. 

3. I will have to learn how to implement third party APIs and how to use the public license keys provided by Google to use the Authentication and Maps APIs.

### Project Tracker
I will probably use Pivotal as my project tracker as it is covered in the material and I have already set it up.
